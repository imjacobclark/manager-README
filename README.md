# Hey, I'm Jake.

_this is a work in progress!_

I'm a Software Engineering Team Lead for Newsround and I line manage all software engineers on this team!

üëãüèªThis README is here to give you an idea of how I think and work day to day, hopefully you'll find this useful and refer back to it from time to time - if you need anything at all, just pop over!

##  My role as team/technical lead

My role varies from team to team and person to person - this will be a very general guide and not exhaustive, I've ordered these in approximate most important first.

1. I am here to support you in your role and career. My main objectives here are to support you in your personal development and growth, help you enjoy your work, coach you through any challenges or issues you face and finally I'll handle your pastoral care such as holidays, sickness and regular one to ones. Ultimately I want you to be the best you can be and I'll go out of my way to understand and support you to achieve that.

2. I am here to guide the current and future technical direction of our product. My role here is to ensure we are aligned with team, product and wider technical strategies to ensure we can constantly ship high quality code and that our product plays nicley with other parts of the business. Ultimatly I want to ensure we can deliver high quality working software at all times.

3. I am here to advise and guide the team on best practices and standards, fostering continous improvement and promoting collaboration across the business to achieve this.

4. Sometimes, I'll write some code, but if I do, It'll be happening as part of a pair or mob! 

Ultimatley though, my top priority is to ensure our team is healthy and moving forwards in the right direction. 

## Making descisions 

My role on the team is not to be an "ultimate descision maker". Whilst I will have opinions and thoughts on most matters, I will only seek  to give advice and guide the team. I am on the other hand accountable for the engineering work within the team.

## Schedule

I'm normally in the office for 9am and leave between 5-5:30pm.

I generally expect people to be in the office before 9:45 and leave anytime after 4pm (providing you've worked your contracted hours that day).

Working from home is OK and as a general guide I recomend once every 2 weeks. You should let me know as soon as possible if you need to  work from home. I understand that things happen, if something unexpected crops up like your car won't start, get in touch with me as soon as possible to let me know you can't make it in and will be working from home for the day.

If you are working from home, I expect that you'll make arrangements to dial into any meetings you're required at that day, including  standup.
